Resident will\nbe responsible for all damages caused by Resident's failure to comply with this Contract or with any\napplicable law, or by Resident's occupancy or use of the Unit, including but not limited to, fire, smoke,\ngrease or cooking fires, or activation of the sprinkler system caused by Resident (or Resident's occupants\nor guests).

Resident shall provide written proof of the Liability Policy\nin the form of a declaration page or certificate if insurance prior to the date on which Resident occupies\nthe Unit, and thereafter upon Landlord\u2019s request.

The Security Deposit will be held at JP Morgan Chase Bank (bank or financial\ninstitution) in an account used solely for that purpose. The Security Deposit will not serve as Landlord\u2019s limit to\ndamages should Resident violate this Contract.

If the Security Deposit is reduced\nin order to apply all or part of it to Resident\u2019s unpaid obligations, Resident agrees that Resident will deposit\nwithin three (3) days following receipt of Landlord\u2019s demand, the funds necessary to restore the Security\nDeposit to the amount listed in the Schedule of Additional Fees. Following the End Date, the Security Deposit\nshall be returned to Resident after deducting any amounts owed for unpaid obligations or damages. The\nSecurity Deposit does not release Resident from the obligation of leaving the Bedroom and Unit in a good and\nclean condition, reasonable use and wear excepted, at the end of the Contract Term. If the Facility is\ntransferred to a new owner, and the Security Deposit is transferred to such new owner, unless applicable law\nprovides otherwise, Landlord will not have any further liability for the return of all or any portion of the Security\nDeposit to the Resident, and Resident will look to the new owner for reimbursement or disputes.\n\nContract Guaranty.
